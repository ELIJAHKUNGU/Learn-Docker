# GETTING STARTED WITH DOCKER 
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.


## Why need a docker 
1. Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers.
2. They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests.
3 . When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.
4. When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment.
